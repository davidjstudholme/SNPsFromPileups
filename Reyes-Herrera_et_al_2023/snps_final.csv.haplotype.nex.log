Host:    studholme-climb-0 (AVX, 31 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree2 -s snps_final.csv.haplotype.nex -m GTR+ASC
Seed:    468967 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Sat Apr 15 14:12:44 2023
Kernel:  AVX - 1 threads (4 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 4 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
